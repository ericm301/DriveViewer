Yeah, ok, so maybe no widget, yet. Soon...

But, I'm starting to figure things out.

You see, I'm not a developer. I'm just a guy who likes to code.

I'm writing this so I can keep track of my experience and maybe someone else can learn something from it.

Maybe.

I'm also writing this assuming I'm the only one reading it, so I may be cryptic at times, or seem to make assumptions about your knowledge level, etc. Sorry. Ask me to explain later.

So, First!1!!: How to Create an Extension for Chrome

Go to Getting Started: Building Chrome Extension

Note: As of this writing, the code given on that page has an error in it. To fix it, open popup.js and replace 'kittensOnFlickr_' with 'searchOnFlickr_'

Nice, google. A simple coding error in a tutorial. Well played. I thought you weren't evil.

Once you get all those files into a directory, open chrome://extensions, and click on the button "Load Unpacked Extensions" Point the file selector at your folder, and viola! kitties everywhere!

That's all for now. Soon, I'll turn this into an ANTP widget.
